    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The original intention was to issue a book form identity card very much like the driving license 
        of the 1970s because of the need to accommodate the 2"x2" size photos which were the norm at the time. 
        This resulted in limited use of the ID. For example, fishermen could not use it as the book would get wet. 
        It was necessary to make it easy to carry and waterproof while standing up to rough handling. 
        T. B. Ekanayake, the first Commissioner of Registration of Persons, contacted Dr. D. B. Nihalsingha, the Director 
        of the Government Film Unit, and handed over the responsibility for the design of an easy to carry the card. Gaspe Ratnayake, 
        the artist of the GFU, designed the card, which is the same design even today. For the first time 35mm still film was proposed 
        by Dr. Nihalsingha and the aid of the GDR was sought. The GDR donated 5000 35mm Praktica cameras along with 400-foot rolls of 
        35mm cine film and spare cassettes to load the film. These were issued to studios around the country with instructions as to how 
        to pose the photo. 35mm still photography became the norm with this step and the 2"x2" Rolleiflex photos receded. In February 1972, 
        Ekanayake stated that all legal citizens will be issued with an indenty card.</p>
